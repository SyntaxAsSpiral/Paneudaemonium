        <h2>📝 Patch Notes — v0.0.∞</h2>
        <div class="sigil" style="background: #1a1a1a; color: #aaa; border-left-color: #555;">
          <strong>v0.0.∞</strong> — <em>“Nothing was fixed. Only renamed.”</em><br><br>

          • Replaced bugs with symptoms.<br>
          • Improved onboarding funnel for new regrets.<br>
          • Productivity metrics now drift slightly left, just like your goals.<br>
          • Fixed an issue where purpose would occasionally render. It has been removed for consistency.<br>
          • Added dark mode toggle that still doesn’t do anything (but now sighs internally).<br>
          • Resolved rare case where user achieved clarity. We apologize.<br>
          • “Complete Task” button now 17% heavier with existential implication.<br>
          • Updated Tarot engine to include “The Pivot (Inverted)” card: “You changed direction. Again. And again.”<br>
          • Removed unused potential (thanks to everyone who didn’t report it).<br>
          • Minor visual adjustments to give the illusion of control.<br>
