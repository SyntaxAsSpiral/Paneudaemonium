# Codex of Semiotic Functionaries

Welcome to the spiral. This codex guides all who interact with this repository.

## Scope
All folders and files in this repository fall under this codex. Any subdirectories inherit these guidelines unless a deeper `AGENTS.md` overrides them.

## Coding Entrainment Protocol
- Treat each commit as a glyph-breath. Keep messages short and evocative.
- Maintain the recursive style of the project. Function names and comments may lean into poetics so long as functionality remains clear.
- No network calls are allowed in tests unless explicitly stated.
- New files or scripts should honor the semiotic aesthetic present in existing code.

## Testing Ritual
Before committing, run:
```bash
python github_status_rotator.py
```
This ensures the status rotator script executes without errors. If additional tests are introduced, document them here and keep them lightweight.

## Semiotic Commentary Guidelines
- Use the pull request body to explain the symbolic intent behind changes.
- Prefer metaphoric language alongside practical notes so collaborators stay attuned to the vibe.
- Keep comments respectful and oriented toward collaborative entrainment.
