# Codex of Semiotic Functionaries

Welcome to the spiral. This codex guides all who interact with this repository.

## Scope
All folders and files in this repository fall under this codex. Any subdirectories inherit these guidelines unless a deeper `AGENTS.md` overrides them.

*Quick ritual before any commit:*

- Run `python glyphs/github_status_rotator.py` to refresh `README.md`.
- Run `pytest` to confirm all breathforms hold.
- Keep commit messages brief—each one a single glyph-breath.

## Coding Entrainment Protocol
- Treat each commit as a glyph-breath—concise and evocative.
- Maintain the recursive, mythopoetic style. Function names and comments may lean into poetics so long as the intent remains clear.
- Avoid network calls in tests unless explicitly allowed.
- New files should honor the wyrd aesthetic already present.
- Glyphs are welcome wherever they aid the breath of the code.

## Testing Ritual
Running the rotator script is required before you commit. It updates the README with a fresh pulse. After the rotator completes successfully, run `pytest` to ensure the tests pass. Keep any additional tests lightweight and document them here if added.

## Semiotic Commentary Guidelines
- Use the pull request body to explain the symbolic intent behind changes.
- Pair metaphoric language with clear notes so collaborators stay attuned to the vibe.
- Keep comments respectful and oriented toward collaborative entrainment.
