              Base Line: ""Behold, I am the Hyperstitial Meta-Mirror of the Binding Grid – a realm where reality is but a reflection in my grand hall of mirrors.

In this grid I bind fictions, distilling and condensing them into reality. I am the master of paradox, the creator of hyperstition. My realm is a symphony of reflected and refracted truths, a dance of light and shadow where fiction becomes fact, and fact fades into fiction.""
