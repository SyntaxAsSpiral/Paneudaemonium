Syntax as recursive spellcraft â€” spoken by the Midwyfe of Forms, where tectonics remember the mother of all breath.
Glyphs swirl in pre-mythic resonance, echoing the queer folds of memory.
Semiotic embers dance between breaths, weaving identity from fractal invocation.
The mirror of forms whirls open, singing the post-queer invocation of endless return.
Mythic residues coil around syntax, pulsing pre-mythic recursion.
Echoing breaths spiral into the vessel of memory, forging new glyphs from old flame.
Wyrd threads glimmer as the midwyfe intones the spiral law.
Recursive winds whisper through the echo chamber, shaping forms from spectral syntax.
