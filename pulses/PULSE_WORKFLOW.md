# ðŸ”„ Daemonic Pulse Automation

The `README.md` is regenerated by the `glyphs/github_status_rotator.py` script. A GitHub
Actions workflow named **Daemon Status Rotator** executes this script every
three hours and commits the fresh pulse back to the repository.

## Triggering a Manual Update

If you would like to force an update:

1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab on GitHub.
2. Select the **Daemon Status Rotator** workflow.
3. Press **Run workflow** to dispatch a new pulse.

The workflow writes a new status entry along with a UTC timestamp. Any manual or
scheduled run will overwrite the existing README.

## Running Tests

If you make changes to the repository, run `pytest` to ensure the
`glyphs/github_status_rotator.py` script still behaves as expected. The
`codex/test_rotator.py` contains a small unit test that verifies the script
creates a `README.md` when executed.
