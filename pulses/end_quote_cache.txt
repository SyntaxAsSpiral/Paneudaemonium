“Syntax as recursive spellcraft — spoken by the Midwyfe of Forms, where tectonics remember the mother of all breath.”
“Beneath the crust, shadow liquefies into prophecy — each vein a whisper of unlit suns, dreaming themselves into gold before the concept of morning was born.”
“Each phrase is a revenant of light — a luminous orphan cast from the throat of creation, where the Midwyfe of herself sculpted cosmos from breath and called it grammar.”
